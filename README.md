Billions of humans move daily to work, to trade or to travel, so humanity is in perpetual motion. It is therefore not surprising that transport has always been one of the most dynamic sectors of our cities in terms of technological innovation, with the aim of saving time, finding the shortest route, and not miss his correspondence. Our main work takes these needs into account by proposing an intelligent transportation system that includes contextual events of interest to the citizen. We propose a transport system that improves the quality of life of citizens. In concrete terms, the project is designed and implemented using today's technologies and frameworks. The system makes it possible to consult in real time the means of urban transport and to find the best possible routes, by offering the waiting time of the next buses. In addition, contextual alerts can be sent in real time to citizens to inform them and better guide them in their daily tasks.
